# F1 Leaderboard Database

# Currently In Progress!
## Does not work yet. ðŸ¥º

## A fully functional conceptual leaderboard database project written in Python to display information on each race starting from 2021 and ending at 2023.

The "F1 Leaderboard Database" is a platform designed to provide users with a detailed view of historical F1 race data. It showcases season-by-season leaderboards, offers insights into tire strategies used by drivers, and presents an updated overview of points accumulated by teams and drivers after each race.
