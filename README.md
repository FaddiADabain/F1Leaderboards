# F1 Leaderboard Database

# Currently In Progress!
## Does not work yet. ðŸ¥º

## A fully functional conceptual leaderboard database project written in Python to display information on each race starting from 2021 and ending at 2023.

The "F1 Leaderboard Database" is a platform designed to provide users with a detailed view of historical F1 race data. It showcases season-by-season leaderboards, offers insights into tire strategies used by drivers, and presents an updated overview of points accumulated by teams and drivers after each race.

## Watch how this works!
Video will be added displaying how program works soon.

## How to install and run
1. Download python 3.11 or newer
2. After opening up the .exe for python installation, SELECT THE BOX THAT SAYS 'Add python.exe to PATH', then select 'Install Now'
3. Install all the prerequisites in command prompt
4. Install any python interpreter (VSCode will be used for this installation process)
5. Unzip the folder to a memorable location
6. Open VSCode using a new window
7. Select 'Open Folder...'
8. Open the unzipped folder once and select the folder that is inside
9. Select the main.py file and install the Python extension from Microsoft (This option should show up at the bottom right of the window after selecting the main.py file)
10. Press run at the top right of the window (arrow pointing right)

## Issues trying to run after starting the program once
After you start the program once and close the program, there is a known issue where VSCode does not run again.
The solution to this is to select the terminal that opened up at the bottom of the window and press CTRL + C on your keyboard. The program should be able to run again.
If this issue persists, select the trash icon at the top right of the terminal window.
